# ComputerOpoly

This game was made for my Java Final in 2015.

You can change the nature of the theme by editing the CSV.

Features include AI support for up to 7 computer players. AI will buy houses, sell and buy properties from other players, and most of the time win!

If there is to much text on the command line type 9 for a replay action and if you seem to be losing to much money type anything besides 1-9 for a money cheat!

Try to beat the computer good luck!
